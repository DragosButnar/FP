"""
Write an application that manages a list of circles.
Each circle has a unique center (x,y - ints) and a positive radius (int).
The application will have a menu-driven user interface and will provide the following features:

    1. Add a circle
        - adds the given circle to the list.
        - error if circle with given center already exists, the center or radius not given, empty or radius < 0

    2. Delete a circle
        - deletes the circle with the given center
        - error if non-existing center is given

    3. Show all circles
        - shows all circles in descending order of their radius

    4. Show circles that intersect a given one
        - select a circle from the list of existing circles
        - print those which intersect it
        (bonus: sort printed circles by descending order of radius)

    5. exit
        - exit the program

    Observations:
        - Add 10 random circles at program startup
        - Write specifications for non-UI functions
        - Each function does one thing only, and communicates via parameters and return value
        - The program reports errors to the user. It must also report errors from non-UI functions!
        - Make sure you understand the circle's representation
        - Try to reuse functions across functionalities (Less code to write and test)
        - Don't use global variables!
